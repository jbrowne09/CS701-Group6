A custom designed RECOP processor (A form of RISC) intended to interface with multiple individually designed application specific processors(ASPs)
through a Time Division Multiple Access(TDMA) interface.

Note:
* Some files were provided as apart of the assignment brief; the group was only intended to design and implment the RECOP and their invididual
  ASP designs. The provided files include:
  
  * Any TDMA interface files
  * AdcDac.vhd

* Project information including RECOP design and instructions are included in the report: 'Group6_Report.pdf'
* The RECOP design was the group portion of the project addtionally each group member was required to implement their own 
  Application Specific Processor(ASP) capable of performing signal processing on an input signal. The required signal processing
  methods/algorithms were:

  * Linera filter
  * Minimum/Maximum peak detection
  * Correlation

* While the RECOP was finished and functioned as intended the individual ASP designs were at various states of completion and did not all function
  correctly. This was due to time constraints and difficulties performing testing with COVID-19 lockdowns and forced remote work for most of the 
  year(2020)
* Work was split amongst the group and some blocks were developed collaboratively whilst some were developed by only 1 or 2 group member(s):
  I (Jonathan Browne) worked more on the Recop blocks including the ALU, ControlBlock, RegisterFile, etc. but did little work on the Audio 
  files or ADC/DAC files. Additionally any files labelled with an Identifier (jbro682, bwil410, sbol998) were involved with the individual 
  ASPs and were made exclusively by the person labelled
